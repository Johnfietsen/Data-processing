Explain the difference between the == operator and the === operator:
    == also takes type conversion into account (None == Undefined is true).
    === does not, meaning they are only equal if the type of object is the same
        (None === Undefined is false).

Explain what a closure is:
    It is a way to make a variable local (instead of global). It means turning
    a variable into a function in which private variables can be used.

Explain what higher order functions are:
    Higher order functions are functions that takes a function as an argument,
    or returns a function.

Explain what a query selector is and give an example line of JavaScript that

        document.querySelector(".example");
